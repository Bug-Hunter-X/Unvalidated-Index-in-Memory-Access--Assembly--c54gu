This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory with an unvalidated index. The `bug.asm` file shows the erroneous code that is prone to segmentation faults due to an unchecked index.  The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version that incorporates bounds checking before accessing memory.  The primary issue lies in the use of `ecx` to index the memory location without proper range verification, which makes the program vulnerable to unexpected behavior when ecx values are out of bounds. The solution illustrates how to add boundary checks to prevent the potential crashes.
